        "**Erlotinib** is a targeted cancer therapy that acts as an inhibitor of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase and therefore serves as a valuable starting point for drug discovery efforts. In this project, we aim to use the  [SMILES-RNN](https://github.com/MorganCThomas/SMILES-RNN) generative model by Morgan Thomas to perform de novo drug design, starting from the SMILES of erlotinib. The goal is to generate novel molecules that retain or improve upon erlotinib’s activity while potentially offering better pharmacokinetic properties or overcoming resistance mechanisms.\n",
